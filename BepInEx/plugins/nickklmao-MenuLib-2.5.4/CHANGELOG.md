  - If true is returned then the menu will be closed, otherwise the menu remains open
  - If this field is null, the menu closes by default
- Added `REPOInputStringSystem` which provides necessary functionality for handling input
  - The biggest downside is a lack of caret position (arrow keys) and highlighting
  - CTRL + C copies the current text to your clipboard
  - CTRL + X copies the current text to your clipboard and clears the text field
  - CTRL + V pastes your clipboard to the end of the text field

- Fixed `REPOScrollView` from not updating when setting the `spacing` property post-creation

- Scroll views now update when you're not hovering over them
  - This resolved some weird issues with dynamically adding items

  - This should fix issues with custom TMP rich text sizes

# v2.1.1
- Fixed REPOPopupPage parameters (they were backwards)
- Fixed an issue causing custom REPOPopupPage sizes to break cached pages
- Updated REPOTextScroller to fetch a TMP component if its missing one
  - It only checks the object it was added to
- Added `overrideButtonSize` to REPOButton
  - This will force a custom size rather than using the label size

# v2.1.0

- Added cached pages
  - This prevents you from having to regenerate your menu constantly
    - You can only set this via the `MenuAPI.CreateREPOPage` method

  - Introduces REPOLabel, REPOButton, & REPOSpacer
  - This gives you almost full control over your elements
- **Plus a lot more**

# v1.0.5

  - Changes the behavior of the background bar (UpdateWithValue, StaticMinimum, StaticMaximum)
  - This would typically be used for `Enum` types
