# MoreUpgrades
- Adds more upgrade items to the game.
- The upgrade item designs are made by "Kizzycocoa". [1277336819951730739]
- All players need to have the same config! (**Note:** Some of them can be client-sided or server-sided.)
- Some upgrade items have more configuration. Check the config file after updates, as values may change between versions.

## Library
- I wish REPOLib would handle this globally so I don't have to make this mod a library again.
```csharp
float ItemValueMultiplier(Item item) // This is based on the "Price Multiplier" config entry. When under 0, it returns "ShopManager.instance.itemValueMultiplier"
float UpgradeValueIncrease(Item item) // This is based on the "Price Increase Scaling" config entry. When under 0, it returns "ShopManager.instance.upgradeValueIncrease"
```
